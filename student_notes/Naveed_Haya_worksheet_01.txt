A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. You 
flip the coin another 5 times, same result. How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin?
Explain your reasoning a bit.


Given it's a fair coin, 
probability of getting heads = 0.5
probability of getting tails = 0.5

(Side calculation:
Expected number of unsuccessful trials (i.e. getting heads ) before we see tails can be modeled as a geometric distribution with 
probability of failure p  - 0.5. 
Number of unsuccessful trials excluding last successful trial (where we get tails) = p/1-p  = 0.5/0.5 = 1)

Answer: 
probability of getting heads 10 times = 0.5^10 = 0.0009765625. The probability of getting 10 heads in a row is extremely low, which
makes this event unsusual but not necessarily indicate that the coin is unfair. However, if we were to observe a significant number of 
consecutive heads repeatedly (e.g., 20, 30, or more times), it might raise suspicions about the fairness of the coin, since the 
probability of getting 20 or 30 heads in a row is even more extremely low. 
It's important to recognize that streaks of heads/tails can happen by chance; for instance, if multiple isolated streaks of heads occurred
at different points in time I wouldn't necessarily get suspicious. However, as the length of an individual streak increases (i.e. 
we keep getting the same outcome as number of flips increase), I would start getting suspicious. To give a concrete number, I would 
start doubting the fairness of the coin if I observe a streak of heads (or tails) for more than 17 consecutive flips. The probability
of such an event happening is incredibly low (7.629×10^−6) and warrants further inspection.
